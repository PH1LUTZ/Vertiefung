    "#### Based on the provided probabilities, there is a slight difference in conversion rates between the control group (0.1204) and the treatment group (0.1188), but the overall conversion rate regardless of the page received is 0.1196. The difference in conversion rates is subtle, and further statistical analysis, such as hypothesis testing, is needed to determine if this difference is statistically significant. Therefore, based solely on these probabilities, it is not conclusive whether the new treatment page leads to more conversions."

This value is called the p-value in scientific studies. A high p-value, such as 0.9082, suggests that a large proportion of simulated differences are greater than the observed difference, indicating that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In this context, it suggests that the new page does not lead to a significantly higher conversion rate compared to the old page."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Based on the analysis, the conclusion is that the statistical assessment does not provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis which states that the conversion rate for the new page is equal to or less than that of the old page. The computed p-values exceed the conventional significance level of 0.05, suggesting no statistically significant difference in conversion rates between the control and treatment groups. The logistic regression model indicates that the page type does not significantly influence the likelihood of conversion. The exponentiated coefficients suggest a slight decrease in conversion odds for the new page, reinforcing the conclusion that the new page does not significantly improve conversion rates over the old page. It's also noted that while incorporating additional factors into the regression model could lead to a more nuanced analysis, it runs the risk of multicollinearity and overfitting if not carefully managed.\n",

    "### Gather Submission Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are satisfied with the status of your Notebook, you should save it in a format that will make it easy for others to read. You can use the __File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)__ menu to save your notebook as an .html file. If you are working locally and get an error about \"No module name\", then open a terminal and try installing the missing module using `pip install <module_name>` (don't include the \"<\" or \">\" or any words following a period in the module name).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will submit both your original Notebook and an HTML or PDF copy of the Notebook for review. There is no need for you to include any data files with your submission. If you made reference to other websites, books, and other resources to help you in solving tasks in the project, make sure that you document them. It is recommended that you either add a \"Resources\" section in a Markdown cell at the end of the Notebook report, or you can include a `readme.txt` file documenting your sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submit the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're ready, click on the \"Submit Project\" button to go to the project submission page. You can submit your files as a .zip archive or you can link to a GitHub repository containing your project files. If you go with GitHub, note that your submission will be a snapshot of the linked repository at time of submission. It is recommended that you keep each project in a separate repository to avoid any potential confusion: if a reviewer gets multiple folders representing multiple projects, there might be confusion regarding what project is to be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can take us up to a week to grade the project, but in most cases it is much faster. You will get an email once your submission has been reviewed. If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at dataanalyst-project@udacity.com. In the meantime, you should feel free to continue on with your learning journey by beginning the next module in the program."
